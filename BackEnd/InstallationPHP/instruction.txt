The file name are self explanatory.

The only file need attention here is php.ini.
Move that file into /etc/php/7.0/apache2/php.ini
  or where apache server is loading its php.ini file
  This can be found by having a php file that does phpinfo(); and go to that php file on web browser. It will tell you which ini file it's loading up. Move this php file into the
  desinated location. Or just change php.ini's post_max_size and also upload_max_filesize to be same as well. If uploaded file is greate than post_max_size, $_FILES will be empty.

Also do     chown -R www-data /dir/for/file/uploads   THIS WILL GIVE PHP SCRIPT PERMISSION TO WRITE TO CERTAIN FOLDER.
